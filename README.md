```
php  -S localhost:5050
```

Thenn open your browser and in the address bar type ```  localhost:5050\?json ```

You will get the results then look for your name and check the status. If it shows pass, you are good to go, make a pull request, if it shows fail, look for the problem.

## Script validation

Your script will be valid if its in this format:

```
Hello World, this is [yourfull-name] with HNGi7 ID [yourID] using [language] for stage 2 task
```

Also you should have an emails variable and assign it your email. This is mandatory as your script will not pass if its missing.
